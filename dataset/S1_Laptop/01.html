To reach the tidal bench marks from the high school in Quilcene, proceed south
on U.S. Highway 101 for 13.44 km (8.35 mi) to a paved road leading to the
Washington Shellfish Laboratory at Whitney Point, then turn and proceed NE on
paved road for 3.9 km (2.4 mi) to the State Shellfish Laboratory Building.  The
bench marks are located between the Laboratory Building and the helicopter pad, 
The tide gage and staff were located on the east side of the pier, on the sixth
and fifth pilings, respectively, from shore.

SETTING CLASSIFICATION:  In a rock


The bench mark is a disk located in a large rock that is submerged at times and
which forms part of a bulkhead at the north end of a pipe for salt water flowing
between ponds, 91 m (300 ft) west of a floating pier and 91 m (300 ft) NW of the
NW corner of the Washington State Shellfish Laboratory.  NOTE: The bench mark's
stamping is barely discernable.

Mean Sea Level (MSL) is a tidal datum determined over a 19-year National Tidal
Datum Epoch.  It pertains to local mean sea level and should not be confused
with the fixed datums of North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88).

NGVD 29 is a fixed datum adopted as a national standard geodetic reference for
heights but is now considered superseded.  NGVD 29 is sometimes referred to as
Sea Level Datum of 1929 or as Mean Sea Level on some early issues of Geological
Survey Topographic Quads.  NGVD 29 was originally derived from a general
adjustment of the first-order leveling networks of the U.S. and Canada after
holding mean sea level observed at 26 long term tide stations as fixed.
Numerous local and wide-spread adjustments have been made since establishment in
1929.  Bench mark elevations relative to NGVD 29 are available from the National
Geodetic Survey (NGS) data base via the World Wide Web at 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ngs_opsd.prl?PID=SY1164">National Geodetic Survey</a>.

NAVD 88 is a fixed datum derived from a simultaneous, least squares, minimum
constraint adjustment of Canadian/Mexican/United States leveling observations.
Local mean sea level observed at Father Point/Rimouski, Canada was held fixed as
the single initial constraint.  NAVD 88 replaces NGVD 29 as the national
standard geodetic reference for heights.  Bench mark elevations relative to
NAVD 88 are available from NGS through the World Wide Web at 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ngs_opsd.prl?PID=SY1164">National Geodetic Survey</a>.

NGVD 29 and NAVD 88 are fixed geodetic datums whose elevation relationships to
local MSL and other tidal datums may not be consistent from one location to
another.

The Vertical Mark Number (VM#) and PID# shown on the bench mark sheet are unique
identifiers for bench marks in the tidal and geodetic databases, respectively.
Each bench mark in either database has a single, unique VM# and/or PID# assigned.
Where both VM# and PID# are indicated, both tidal and geodetic elevations are
available for the bench mark listed.

The NAVD 88 elevation is shown on the Elevations of Tidal Datums Table Referred
to MLLW only when two or more of the bench marks listed have NAVD 88 elevations.
The NAVD 88 elevation relationship shown in the table is derived from an average
of several bench mark elevations relative to tide station datum.  As a result of
this averaging, NAVD 88 bench mark elevations computed indirectly from the tidal
datums elevation table may differ slightly from NAVD 88 elevations listed for
each bench mark in the NGS database.
